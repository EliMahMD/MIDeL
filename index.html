<div id="home-header">MIDeL: Medical Image Deep Learning</div>

<div id="home-content">
MIDeL is a website to help healthcare professionals and medical imaging scientists learn to apply deep learning methods to medical images. This website consists of a comprehensive text (think of an electronic textbook) combined with actual code examples to help you learn about Deep Learning.
<br><br>
We specifically focus on the <a href="https://monai.io" target="_blank" style="color:#16b5ff">MONAI</a> framework, as it provides many nice functions that work well with medical images. This means that you will need to use Python and the PyTorch framework. If that sounds intimidating don't worry &#8211; the first few chapters provide background on programming, as well as the math and medical image fundamentals that some of you may lack. If you know this already great &#8211; feel free to skip forward to the chapters where you encounter material that you are not familiar with...

    For each chapter in the text, there is a corresponding IPython/Jupyter Notebook code base, which can be downloaded from GitHub, and executed on a public website like <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank" style="color:#16b5ff">colab.research.google.com</a> or your own server.
