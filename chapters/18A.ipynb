    "## Introduction to Active Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that helps improve model performance while reducing the need for excessive manual labeling. Instead of training a model on a fully labeled dataset, Active Learning allows the model to decide which data points should be labeled, focusing on the most informative samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes the labeling process more efficient by reducing the number of labels needed while still maintaining (or even improving) performance. It’s particularly useful in cases where labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, such as medical imaging, speech recognition, and other domains requiring expert annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The GraNd (Gradient Normed) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "GraNd is a sampling technique used in active learning. It assigns a relevance score to each sample based on the average gradient of the loss. The method typically uses the gradients of the parameters in the penultimate layer of the network (just before the linear layer that yields the class probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "The penultimate layer is chosen for several reasons:\n",
    "1. It represents high-level features learned by the model.\n",
    "2. Gradients at this layer are more informative about the model's learning process than the final layer.\n",
    "3. The final layer often includes a softmax activation, which can mask the true uncertainty of the model.\n",
    "4. Using the penultimate layer makes the method more generalizable across different model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the GraNd method using PyTorch:"

    "  Even though both models were trained on the same amount of data (19%), GraNd selection achieved better accuracy.  \n",

    "- **GraNd vs Base10 only: +0.0176**  \n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you implemented and compared several training strategies to explore the impact of **GraNd-based active learning** in both simple and complex settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You learned how to train a baseline model using only a **random 10% seed set**.\n",
    "- You computed **GraNd (Gradient Norm) scores** to identify the most informative samples **without using labels**.\n",
    "- You trained a model using GraNd-selected data and compared it to a model trained on randomly selected data of the same size.\n",
    "- You also trained a fully supervised model on the entire dataset to establish an upper-bound performance reference.\n",
    "- Finally, you extended the same GraNd strategy to a **3D medical image segmentation task using nnU-Net**, demonstrating how active learning can reduce labeling effort in healthcare AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this workflow, you saw how **GraNd helps prioritize the most impactful samples**, allowing you to approach full-supervision performance with significantly less labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ability to **rank unlabeled data by learning potential** is a powerful tool — especially in real-world domains where annotation is expensive, such as medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now confidently apply GraNd in your own projects to **train smarter, not harder** 🚀\n"
