    "## Introduction to Active Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that helps improve model performance while reducing the need for excessive manual labeling. Instead of training a model on a fully labeled dataset, Active Learning allows the model to decide which data points should be labeled, focusing on the most informative samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach makes the labeling process more efficient by reducing the number of labels needed while still maintaining (or even improving) performance. Itâ€™s particularly useful in cases where labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, such as medical imaging, speech recognition, and other domains requiring expert annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The GraNd (Gradient Normed) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "GraNd is a sampling technique used in active learning. It assigns a relevance score to each sample based on the average gradient of the loss. The method typically uses the gradients of the parameters in the penultimate layer of the network (just before the linear layer that yields the class probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "The penultimate layer is chosen for several reasons:\n",
    "1. It represents high-level features learned by the model.\n",
    "2. Gradients at this layer are more informative about the model's learning process than the final layer.\n",
    "3. The final layer often includes a softmax activation, which can mask the true uncertainty of the model.\n",
    "4. Using the penultimate layer makes the method more generalizable across different model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the GraNd method using PyTorch:"

By focusing on the gradients of the penultimate layer, it captures the model's uncertainty and learning potential for each sample.
